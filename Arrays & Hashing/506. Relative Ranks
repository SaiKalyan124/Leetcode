Approach : store the score in max_heap and pass them to the dict by assigning the rank to it. Finally print the result as per the list score

import heapq
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, score: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        #assigning medals
        medals=["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal"]
        
        #max heap using list score
        heap=[]
        for i in score:
            heapq.heappush(heap,-i)
        #defining dict rank
        rank={}
        rank_count =0
        topk=[-s for s in heap]
        
        
        #assign ranks by poping least element from max_heap
        while heap:
            #pop least element from max_heap
            s = -heapq.heappop(heap)
            rank_count += 1
            if rank_count <= 3:
                rank[s] = medals[rank_count-1]
            else:
                rank[s] = str(rank_count)

        #get the result as per list score
        result=[]
        for i in score:
            result.append(str(rank[i]))
        return result
